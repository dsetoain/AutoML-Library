# OVERVIEW
AutoML-Library is a Python library that provides an end-to-end automated machine learning workflow for tabular datasets. The library handles all stages of a typical ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and pipeline orchestration.

Built with object-oriented design, the library emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability, allowing for easy extension with new models, metrics, or pipeline components.

# PURPOSE
This project was created to:
Explore how end-to-end machine learning workflows can be automated.
Build a reusable, modular Python library for ML experimentation.
Practice designing code with industry-level standards, such as clear architecture, modularity, and maintainability.
Simulate real-world ML engineering tasks to prepare for professional roles.

# KEY FEATURES
Automated Pipelines: Handle the workflow from raw data to model evaluation without manual intervention.
Dataset Management: Load and manage data in a structured way.
Feature Engineering: Detect and manage feature types to prepare data for modeling.
Model Training & Evaluation: Support for multiple model types with consistent evaluation metrics.
Extensible Design: Built with OOP to allow easy extension with new models, metrics, or processing steps.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
Emphasizes object-oriented programming for maintainable, modular code.
Demonstrates realistic AutoML development, going beyond academic assignments.
Designed to reflect how ML projects are structured in professional environments.
Serves as a portfolio project for roles such as ML Engineer or Data Scientist.

# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Expand the library to support additional ML algorithms.
Introduce automated hyperparameter tuning.
Incorporate support for more complex data types (e.g., time series, text).
Add visualization tools for model comparison and evaluation.
